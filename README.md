Timemap.py
==========

Python class to parse an simplify access to Memento timemaps.

There are two versions of the class:
* <code>timemap.py</code> is the original version and completely stand alone.
* <code>LinkTimemap.py</code> is my current version.  It supports the interesting "features" of real-world timemaps that I have discovered over the past few years.  However, it also depends on my UTC time class and URI class.

Note that you will probably need to tweek the import statements for the UTC time and URI classes.
